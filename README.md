# djangoTutorial
This is a project following Corey Schafer's django tutorial on youtube, which builds a blog web application. I've made a few additions along the way, but this project is largely intended as a means of starting to familiarize myself with Django.
Secondarily, I have made an effort to adopt good commit and commit message practices with this project.
